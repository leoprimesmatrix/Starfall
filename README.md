# STARFALL: THE KRYLL INVASION

## Overview
Starfall is a vertical space shooter where you defend the outer colonies of the Galactic Federation against the sudden and overwhelming Kryll invasion. As a newly commissioned pilot thrust into chaos, your mission is to fight back against various enemy types and prevent the Kryll from establishing a foothold in Federation space.

## Story
The Kryll arrive without warning, launching devastating attacks on the outer colonies. As casualties mount and systems fall, you are one of the few pilots available to defend what remains. Your immediate focus is on protecting civilian populations, understanding the enemy, and learning to fight back effectively.
